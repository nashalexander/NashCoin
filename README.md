# NashCoin
A fun learning project to create the Nash blockchain and NashCoin!

## Notes

### Blockchain
A chain of data blocks that each contain the following data points:
- Data (ex: transactions)
- A timestamp
- A hash
- The hash of the previous block

### Functionality
The following functions should be availble:
- Generating a hash for a block
- Add new block that requres proof-of-work computational puzzle
- Validate the chain

### Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake
- Implement Proof of Work and Proof of Stake
